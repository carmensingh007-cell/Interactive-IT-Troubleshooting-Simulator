# Interactive IT Troubleshooting Simulator

## Overview

This project is an interactive, client-side web application built to simulate real-world IT support scenarios in Managed Service Provider (MSP) and Internet Service Provider (ISP) environments. Designed as a portfolio piece, it demonstrates over 2 years of hands-on experience in IT troubleshooting, system maintenance, incident reporting, and customer service—skills directly aligned with junior to mid-level IT support roles. By showcasing practical problem-solving without relying on a formal CS degree, this simulator highlights proficiency in fast-paced, remote support settings using tools like ConnectWise RMM, Datto, and cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).

The app features guided troubleshooting scenarios, an advanced quiz with 30 challenging test cases, real-time feedback, progress tracking, and smooth animations—all built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for seamless CodePen integration (no APIs or backend required).

## Key Features

- **Interactive Troubleshooting Scenarios**: Step-by-step simulations of common IT issues, including network connectivity (VPN/DNS), software installation, hardware diagnostics, backup monitoring (Datto), cloud access (AWS/Azure), email support, escalation in ISP environments, and OS-specific problems (Windows/macOS/Linux). Users select steps, receive feedback, and view documented resolutions—mirroring Level 1-3 support workflows.
  
- **Advanced Quiz Mode**: 30 hard, real-world test cases covering MSP/ISP tools, networking (TCP/IP, VPNs), OS troubleshooting, cloud services, and more. Includes:
  - Immediate right/wrong feedback with explanations.
  - Progress bar for completion tracking.
  - Score counter (e.g., "Score: X / 30") with animations on updates.
  - Incident logging for all answers.

- **Responsive and Animated UI**: Modern, 2026-ready design with gradients, shadows, and Font Awesome icons. Animations include fade-ins, slides, shakes for errors, and scales for correct answers—ensuring an engaging, professional user experience on desktop and mobile (no horizontal scrolling).

- **Skill Demonstration**: Proves expertise in:
  - Technical skills: OS knowledge (Windows, macOS, Linux), networking (TCP/IP, DNS, VPNs), cloud services (AWS, Azure, Google Cloud).
  - Soft skills: Problem-solving, documentation, escalation, and explaining complex issues simply.
  - Tools: Simulates ConnectWise RMM, Datto, and ticketing systems.
  - Independence: Fully client-side, responsive design built from scratch.

This project directly addresses job requirements for roles like Junior IT Support Technician or Support Specialist, emphasizing proactive, accurate support in fast-paced environments.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Styling, responsive design, keyframes for animations (e.g., fadeInUp, slideIn, shake, correct/incorrect effects).
- **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Logic for scenarios, quiz interactivity, DOM manipulation, event handling, and state management (e.g., progress and score tracking).
- **External Libraries**: Font Awesome for icons (via CDN).
- **No Frameworks/APIs**: Pure front-end to showcase raw skills.

## Why This Project?

As a self-taught IT professional with 2+ years in customer-facing support, I created this to prove real-world qualifications for roles in South Africa (remote or hybrid). It goes beyond theory, showing I can handle tickets with speed/precision, collaborate on escalations, and maintain systems in MSP/ISP settings—outshining CS degree holders without practical experience. Keywords for ATS: IT Support, MSP, ISP, ConnectWise RMM, Datto, AWS, Azure, TCP/IP, DNS, VPN, Troubleshooting, Incident Reporting.
